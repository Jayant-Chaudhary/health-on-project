/**
 * Shares every report a patient has already uploaded with one appointment.
 *
 * A clinician reads reports only through `appointment_lab_reports`, so a
 * report uploaded before the appointment existed (or against an earlier
 * visit) is invisible to them until it is shared. Starting the pre-visit
 * check-in is the patient bringing their history to this visit, so the whole
 * library is shared then. The patient can still unshare any report from the
 * Reports page. Idempotent: existing shares are left as they are.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<number>} how many reports are now shared with the appointment
